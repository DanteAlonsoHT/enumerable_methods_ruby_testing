# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort

> In this project, I've implemented my own enumerable methods creating these functions from scratch using Ruby, I expect you can see how the logic of each one method used in this project works individually.

This project is created to improve the skills using Ruby, for this reason, you can use this code to see how Ruby works and to check out if you can implement this code for one of your Ruby projects.

Enumerable methods provided by Ruby allow us to visit every element or pair in a collection, these actions can be ones like calculating, modifying, comparing, etc. In this repository you will see how to create these enumerable methods from scratch using Ruby, so feel free to see the code and check it out in order to see if there is something to improve.

If you want to see how should be the result for each method inside _enumerable_methods_ruby.rb_ you can check it out in the next [LINK.](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/)
